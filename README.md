# Excel-Dashboard Project
  Excel dashboard completely on the richest people in the world
  where we can filter by certain criteria, navigate across the different sections, and refresh our data.

  Work Flow-
   First, 
   we'll analyze the dataset to identify the relevant areas with pivot tables. 
   Second,
   we'll lay out the dashboard structure with shapes and textboxes. 
   Third,
   we'll create the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and charts / visuals like a combo chart and a bar chart. 
   Finally,
   we'll make the dashboard dynamic with pivot table slicers and a navigation bar using hyperlinks so we can navigate across the different worksheets.
